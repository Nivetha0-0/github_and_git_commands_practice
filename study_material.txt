1. git init --> creates a new, empty,local git repo named "Master"

2. we need the branch to be called 'main" soooo 
use : git init -b main

3. git add <filename> to add files to staging area

4. git log --> to view all past commits

5. git add -u --> to add only the modified files and exclude new files

6. git commit -m "msg"

7. git creates a checksum for every commit. Through this, all unsaved changes are tracked

8. write and save files to working directory --> add them to staging area (git add) and then commit them to local .git
